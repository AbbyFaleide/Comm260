<h2 style="color:dimgray">The Most Romantic City in India<br>
- Udaipur, India</h2>
    <img src="midterm-exercise/lakePalace.jpg" width=500px height=300px/>


<p>Long considered the most ‘romantic’ city in all of India, Udaipur<br> 
makes it onto most travelers itineraries and rightfully so. Even during<br> 
the dry season when the lake has shrunk almost leaving the lake palace<br> 
high and dry it’s still a magical setting. With the lake servingas a<br> 
natural barrier, the Rajput’s set up an elaborate castle along it’s<br> 
shores. After successfully defending the castle, they further expanded<br> 
their personal space with castles built on two different islands on the<br>
middle of the lake and a further, summer palace, high atop a nearby hill.</p>

<div><b><blockquote style=color:rgb(58,141,209)>"Married women pray to keep their husbands healthy
    and single women pray to find a good one."</blockquote></b></div>

<p>Once a year, faithful Hindu women dress in their finest and parade around<br> 
town on their way down to the ghats for the Ganguar (also coincides with<br> 
Mewar) festival. The statues represent a version of Pavarti, wife to Shiva<br> 
– one of the three main Hindu gods. Married women pray to keep their<br> 
husbands healthy and single women pray to find a good husband. The festival<br>
is one of the most colorful and famous of Udaipur and Rajhastan.</p>

<p>Part of the Mewar festivities included a “Best Dressed” foreigner<br> 
competition. The Tourist bureau provided the costumes for free so we<br> 
decided to give it a whirl just for the photo opportunities.  After<br> 
watching the fire dancing, the plate spinners and the lady who dances<br> 
around with higher and higher stacks of bowls it was time for the<br> 
‘main event’ – us?  That was what the announcer introduced us as anyways.<br> 
Eight couples in total competed for the title.  We were only told we had<br> 
to dress up and parade out in costume for a few minutes.  Little did we<br>
know that we also be asked a couple of questions – mainly they wanted to<br> 
hear how great India and Udaipur are, have to dance a traditional dance<br> 
and even give our hand at singing. It was all for fun and at the end of<br> 
the day we all had a great time.  When it came time to announce the<br> 
results of the vote, we had won! Dinner at the Lake Palace here we come!</p>
