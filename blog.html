        <p>Good morning everyone! Hope everyone has had a wonderful week so far! I have some exciting news. Not only have I just created my own new blog, but I also attended my <strong><i>first</i> NFL game</strong> this weekend! Minnesota Vikings vs. the Cleveland Browns in Minneapolis! It was such a fun experience and a beautiful day to attend. We got the biggest cheese curds I have ever seen and they were <i>absolutely</i> delicious!</p>
